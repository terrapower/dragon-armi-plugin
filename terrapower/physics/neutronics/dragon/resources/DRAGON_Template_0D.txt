*
*  General DRAGON Input Comments:
*    * DRAGON uses the CLE-2000 format as an input language. 
*      This language is versatile, allowing for loops, conditional (If)
*      statements, etc, to be included within an input deck.
*    * CLE-2000 is also strict. It does not allow input beyond the 72nd column,
*      so one must be aware of this in input construction. Comments are allowed
*      beyond this column.
*    * Tabs are not allowed.
*    * The `*` character begins a comment line, while `!` allows for 
*      in-line comments.
*    * A DRAGON input file is created by calling several DRAGON modules in succession
*      to perform the needed calculation. Modules pass needed data structures to 
*      each other to advance the calculation forward. The goal of this calculation 
*      is to produce and ISOTXS file which is produced by the EDI module.
*    * The general structure of a calling a DRAGON module is as follows:
*
*          output(s) := dragonModule: input(s) :: moduleSettings ;
*
*          Here is an simple example using the FLU module:
*
*          FLUX := FLU: PIJ LIBRARY TRACK :: TYPE B ;
*    
*    * More detail on the operation of DRAGON is outside the
*      scope of this input template. The user manual is available at
*             http://www.polymtl.ca/merlin/downloads/IGE335.pdf
*    * DRAGON is free and once downloaded, more than 300 sample inputs are 
*      available in the \Dragon\data folder.
*    * More detail on the construction of DRAGON inputs is 
*      also available:
*         It is for DRAGON version 3.06H, but much of the information is still relevant. 
*         It provides a Tutorial for how to model a PWR assembly model.
