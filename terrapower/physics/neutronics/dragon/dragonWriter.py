Write DRAGON inputs based on data contained in ARMI objects.

This uses templates and attempts to do most of the logic in code
to build the appropriate data structures. Then, the template engine
is responsible for transforming that data into the format required
for DRAGON to process it as input.

Classes here are intended to be specialized with more design-specific
subclasess in design-specific ARMI apps (or other clients).
