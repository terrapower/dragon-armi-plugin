Write input and execute DRAGON given an ARMI object.

This module makes no assumptions about where the block comes from or when the
execution is to be performed. 

Scheduling and choosing happens in

    Notes
    -----
    DRAGON creates binary files during the run (for example _main001 and _DUMMY).
    These files have the same name regardless of input name or settings so if more than
    one run occurs simultaneously in a directory there will be naming collision issues.
    Therefore, to execute in parallel, the execution occurs in a temporary directory.
    After execution, the output file, and any ISOTXS files are copied to the location
    of the ARMI run (where an input file already resided). The temporary directory is
    also local to the machine, which can help for cluster execution speed.
    Before execution the temporary directory has the input, nuclear data, and executable
    copied over to it for fast execution.
